This repo started as a fork of Vanderlins [ofxVoronoi](https://github.com/vanderlin/ofxVoronoi), but I ended up changing too much code and decided to make it an independent addon.

This addon allows the generation of simple two-dimensional voronoi diagrams inside openframeworks. It uses a modified version of [Stephan Fortune's sweep line algorithm](http://ect.bell-labs.com/who/sjf/) written by Chris H. Rycroft for the [Voro++ project](http://math.lbl.gov/voro++/).
